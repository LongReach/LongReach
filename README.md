## About me

![](images/MeEclipseGlasses.jpg)

_(Updated May, 2025)_

I'm a software developer living in the Boston area, currently looking for new employment opportunities (I'll update this section when that changes). I have a bachelor's degree in computer engineering and over twenty years of professional software development experience. I've been coding since I was nine years old and, to use the old clich√©, have forgotten many more programming languages than most people ever learn.

Over my career, I've worked on (from most to least recent):
* Software for analysis of stock/options market
* Warehouse robotics
* Military simulations (game-like environments)
* Games (console and computer)

I first created this page and most of the public repositories here in 2020, to aid me in a job search. New ones are in progress in 2025.
