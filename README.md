## About me

![](images/MeEclipseGlasses.jpg)

_(Updated May, 2025)_

I'm a software developer living in the Boston area, currently looking for new employment opportunities (I'll update this section when that changes). I have a bachelor's degree in computer engineering and over twenty years of professional software development experience. I've been coding since I was nine years old and, to use the old cliché, have forgotten many more programming languages than most people ever learn.

Over my career, I've worked on (from most to least recent):
* Software for analysis of stock/options market
* Warehouse robotics
* Military simulations (game-like environments)
* Games (console and computer)

I first created this page and most of the public repositories here in 2020, to aid me in a job search. New ones are in progress in 2025.
